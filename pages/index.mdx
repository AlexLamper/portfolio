# Alex Lamper

Hey, I'm a student at the HZ University of Applied Science in Middelburg. I enjoy working with Next.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences. I'm also familiar with other languages, frameworks and tools such as: Laravel, MySQL, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, Figma, Git, Python, Java, Javascript, Typescript, PHP and more...

In this portfolio you can read some general information about me, some projects I made or take a look at some of my drawings. I also own a company called Lucerny where I make beautiful, custom made websites for my clients.
