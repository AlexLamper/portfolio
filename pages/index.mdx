# Alex Lamper

Hey, I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Applied Sciences in Middelburg. I enjoy working with Next.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences.

In this portfolio you can read some general information about me, some projects I made, or just something I want to say online. I also own a company called Lucerny where I try to make beautiful products for my clients.
