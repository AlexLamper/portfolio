# Alex Lamper

Hey, I'm a student at the HZ University of Applied Science in Middelburg. I enjoy working with Next.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences.

In this portfolio you can read some general information about me, some projects I made, some drawings I want to show you, or just something I want to say online! I also own a company called Lucerny where I make beautiful, custom made websites for my clients.
