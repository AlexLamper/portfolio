# Personal Portfolio - Alex Lamper

## Introduction
This project is my personal portfolio website. It serves as a showcase of my skills, achievements, projects and some general information about me. In this README, I'll explain how I created it step by step and share some additional information.

## How I Did It
### 1. Planning
I started by outlining the project's layout, design, and content. I took inspiration from other personal portfolio websites. My main goal was to keep a minimalistic style over the whole website. That's why you don't see any flashy colors or messy parts. I wanted to keep it simple. 

### 2. Technology Stack
For this project, I used the following tools and technologies:
- NextJS (Typescript): For building the portfolio
- TailwindCSS: For styling and making the layout for the application.
- Visual Studio Code: My preferred code editor where I code all my projects in.
- Git & GitHub: For version control and hosting the project repository.

### 3. Design and Development
I designed the website's layout to visualize the structure. Then, I implemented the following features step by step:
- Created a simple and minimalistic home page.
- Added a drawings page, where you can see al my drawings I made.
- Added a posts page, where I share some of my thoughts.
- Added details such as small animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.
